### Quick-start
To quickly get started, clone the repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/juniorxsound/THREE.Webpack.git
```
Make sure you have yarn installed ([or install it](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#mac-stable)) and run
```sh
cd THREE.Webpack && yarn
```
Now you can start developing by running
```sh
yarn run dev
```
### Develop
You can use the following commands from the root of the project:  
`yarn run dev` - Start Webpack development server (supports HMR)   
`yarn run style` - Run prettier and format the code (config is in `.prettierrc`)   
`yarn run build` - Build static markdown and JS bundle into `dist` folder   
`yarn run deploy` - Use `gh-pages` to commit to the static folder to a Github pages branch (needs a `GITHUB_TOKEN` enviorment variable)

### Deploy
This repository uses `Travis CI` for deploying a static page to Github pages. All you need to do is connect the repository to your Travis account, create a Github access token and set the token as an environment variable in Travis under `GITHUB_TOKEN`.
